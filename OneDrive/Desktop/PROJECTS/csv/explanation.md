### Code Explanation

```python
import csv
This line imports the csv module, which provides functionality to read from and write to CSV files.
# Read the CSV file with UTF-8 encoding
with open('results.csv', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
This line opens the file named results.csv in read mode ('r') with UTF-8 encoding. The with statement ensures that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised. The file object is assigned to the variable file.
reader = csv.DictReader(file)
This line creates a csv.DictReader object, which reads the CSV file and maps the information in each row to an OrderedDict whose keys are given by the field names (the first row in the CSV file).
# Initialize a counter
count = 0
This line initializes a counter variable count to 0. This will be used to keep track of the number of rows processed.
# Iterate through the rows and print the first 10 rows
for row in reader:
This line starts a for loop that iterates over each row in the reader object. Each row is an OrderedDict representing a row in the CSV file.
if count < 10:
This line checks if the counter count is less than 10. This condition ensures that only the first 10 rows are processed.
print(row)
If the condition count < 10 is true, this line prints the current row.
count += 1
This line increments the counter count by 1.
else:
    break
If the counter count is not less than 10, the else block is executed, which breaks out of the for loop, stopping further iteration.

In summary, this code reads a CSV file named results.csv with UTF-8 encoding, iterates through its rows, and prints the first 10 rows. ```
